    <h1>Sheet Pan Steak</h1>
    <p>This sheet pan steak dinner has a lot to love—the steak entrée and the potato and green bean sides cook at the same time on a sheet pan and cleanup is minimal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>

            1 pound tenderized round steak
            </li>
        <li>1 (1.06 ounce) package Brazilian steakhouse marinade mix, such as McCormick® Grill Mates® Brazilian Steakhouse Marinade</li>
        <li>

            1/4 cup oil
            </li>
        <li>

            1/4 cup water
            </li>
        <li>

            1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
            </li>
        <li>

            3 cups baby potatoes, halved
            </li>
        <li>

            1 pound French green beans, trimmed
            </li>
        <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package toasted onion & garlic potato seasoning, such as McCormick® Toasted Onion & Garlic Potato Seasoning</li>
        <li>

            2 tablespoons oil
            </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place steak in a resealable plastic bag. Whisk together marinade mix, 1/4 cup oil, water, and red wine vinegar in a small bowl; pour into the bag. Reseal the bag, pressing out excess air, and squeeze bag to coat steak. Marinate steak in the refrigerator for a minimum of 30 minutes or up to overnight. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil. </li>
        <li>Place baby potatoes, green beans, and 2 tablespoons oil in a large resealable plastic bag; toss well to coat. Sprinkle in potato seasoning, reseal the bag, and toss again. </li>
        <li>Spread vegetables in a single layer on the prepared sheet; add steak on top of vegetables. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and steaks are firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 1 hour. Turn on the broiler, and broil steak for 3 minutes. Turn steak over and broil 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
